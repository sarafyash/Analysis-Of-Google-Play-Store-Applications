# Analysis-Of-Google-Play-Store-Applications

##A Data Visualization Project on Analysis Of Google  Play Store  Applications by using online tool - Power BI

### Dataset used - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps?resource=download&select=googleplaystore.csv

In the first quarter of 2021, the number of apps available on the Google Play Store was 3.48 million. With such an oversaturated market, app developers must identify the factors that influence consumers' preferences to distinguish their applications. Developing a good app requires significant time and teamwork, so it is important that developers are adequately compensated for their efforts. However, the question remains: what type of applications should be developed?


The outcome of our project is to demonstrate the relevance of app reviews as a determining factor for the number of installs in the market.
